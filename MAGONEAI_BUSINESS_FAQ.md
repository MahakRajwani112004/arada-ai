### What are "agents" in MagoneAI?

Think of agents as different types of assistants, each good at different things:

**Conversational Agent**
Like a friendly receptionist who can chat and answer questions.
*Best for: Customer support, general Q&A*

**Knowledge Agent**
Like a librarian who can find information in your documents.
*Best for: Policy questions, documentation search, FAQ*

**Task Agent**
Like an executive assistant who can take actions for you.
*Best for: Scheduling, emails, creating tasks*

**Complete Agent**
Like a senior employee who can do everything - chat, search, and act.

**Router Agent**
Like a receptionist who directs people to the right department.
*Best for: First point of contact, ticket routing*

**Team Coordinator**
Like a manager who coordinates multiple assistants working together.
*Best for: Complex multi-step processes*

### What are "workflows"?

Workflows are automated multi-step processes. Instead of one assistant doing one thing, a workflow chains multiple steps together.

**Example: Customer Support Workflow**
```
Customer sends message
    ↓
AI understands what they need (billing? technical? general?)
    ↓
Routes to the right specialist AI
    ↓
Specialist AI answers or takes action
    ↓
Quality check ensures good response
    ↓
Customer gets answer
```

**Example: HR Request Workflow**
```
Employee asks about time off
    ↓
AI checks policy documents
    ↓
AI looks at employee's balance
    ↓
Provides answer or initiates request
```

### What are "skills"?

Skills are expertise packages that make AI assistants smarter in specific areas.

**Example Skills:**
- **Legal Skill**: Knows legal terminology, contract review steps, common clauses
- **Sales Skill**: Knows how to handle objections, qualifying questions, follow-up best practices
- **HR Skill**: Knows company policies, employment law basics, HR processes
- **Technical Support Skill**: Knows troubleshooting steps, product specs, common issues

When you add a skill to an assistant, it gains that expertise instantly.

### What is a "knowledge base"?

A knowledge base is a collection of your documents that AI can search through.

**What you can upload:**
- PDF documents
- Word files
- Policy manuals
- Product guides
- Training materials
- FAQ documents

**What happens:**
Your assistant can now find and use information from these documents to answer questions accurately.
